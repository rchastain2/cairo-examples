<h1>
The Montreal Chess font.</h1>

<dl>
<dt>
<font size="+2">Features.</font></dt>

<ul>
<li>
No white bias! Turn the page upside-down and the pieces look the same!</li>

<li>
Pawn structure stands out clearly.</li>

<li>
White and Black counterparts are not just negatives, they are their own
design.</li>

<li>
Faithful to the spirit of the Staunton design, the geometry and
symmetry of each piece indicates its direction of movement.</li>
<li>
The pieces sit centred in each square, not on the baselines.</li>
</ul>
</dl>

<h3>
See the font in some scanned images:  you'll flip over these
diagrams!</h3>
I have scanned three printouts of the Montreal font at 48pt, rather large,
but it will let you see the detail on your screen.&nbsp; The images were
printed on a 600dpi laser printer, and scanned into GIF files at 100dpi.&nbsp;
As a result, there are some digitization artifacts in the dark
square hashing which are not present on the paper output.

<h3>
Technical issues.</h3>
This TrueType fonts was designed mostly for print applications, and will
not look too good on screen. However, it is quite reasonble at point
size 24, and still legible at 16. The font was saved without hints, which
did not seem to make any discernable difference anyway.
<p>The character mapping I used was culled from the most popular mappings
which I found at the very helpful Web site of the&nbsp; <a href="http://www.enpassant.dk/chess/homeeng.htm">Nørresundby
Chess Club.</a>

<h4>
How to get the font.</h4>
I'm willing to give you the font in return for some feedback.&nbsp; I would
be willing to continue work on it if there is any demand.&nbsp; If the
comments are favourable I will make the initial font freely available,
and make a shareware version with more border styles, Informant symbols,
etc.&nbsp; If you would like the font, e-mail me <i><a href="mailto:gpkatch@alcor.concordia.ca">gpkatch@alcor.concordia.ca
</a></i>and we can discuss delivery options.
<p>I've done limited testing, but have seen good results on Windows 3.11,
Windows 95, and Windows NT.
<br>For some reason it there is a display bug on my NT station, but it
prints properly.
</p><h2>
History.</h2>
I didn't set out to design a font. My first goal was to make a pocket chess
set which was actually useable. There are two types of these. One is simply
a scaled down version of regular pieces, which either have pegs that fit
in holes in the sqaures, or they are magnetic. The problem with these sets
is that the pieces are too small to be handled easily, and secondly, the
detail is so small that it becomes difficult to discern one piece from
another, especially king from queen and bishop from pawn.
<p>The second type uses ordinary checkers with chess figurines
embossed, stamped, printed or otherwise displayed on them. These can provide
better distinction between pieces, but they are generally of poor quality,
the symbols are far from standard, and every piece must be oriented toward
the viewer.
</p><p>I asked myself why it was that these sets, whose boards are typically
five inches square, were deemed too small to use, when if fact most chess
players comfortably read book diagrams only two inches square!&nbsp;&nbsp;
The answer was in the clarity of detail:&nbsp; when the symbol has good
contrast and a strong outline, it is usable to a very small size.
</p><p>The orientation problem was something else. Sometimes I would have liked
to study from printed material and see the board from Black's perspective.
This takes some getting used to. I remember seeing the game of shogi being
played. This Japanese game uses identical tiles with symbols engraved on
them, and each player orients his own tiles toward himself, and sees his
opponent's tiles upside-down. Why, I wondered, didn't they just use different
shapes for the pieces instead of symbols? My second inspiration came from
ordinary playing cards. Each card looks basically the same for opposing
players.
</p><p>I wanted to design chess symbols which were clear, easily recognizable,
and symmetric. After many weeks of doodling and drawing, I came up with
a set of symbols, with heavy inspiration from Staunton design sets and
the Linares typeface, which I thought were usable and aesthetically pleasing.
I used a paint program to draw the symbols and print them. I had these
large drawings photo-reduced, copied to adhesive paper, then cut them out
and pasted them on top of an existing set of checkers. This was done around
1992. I still have this prototype and find it very convenient and pleasurable
to use.
</p><p>Years later and I found myself with the means to buy a font-making program.
Several hours of learning the tools and playing has resulted in what I
think is a very novel and pleasing font. I named it Montreal, for the city
in which I live, because other well-known fonts were named after cities,
Linares, Hasting, and Zurich.
